### 7 Reasons Your Ghana Business Needs a Website

Many business owners in Ghana still rely solely on WhatsApp and social media for their online presence. While these platforms are great, they're not enough anymore. Here's why:

### 1. Credibility and Trust

When potential customers search for your business and find a professional website, it immediately builds trust. A website shows you're serious about your business.

### 2. You Don't Own Social Media

Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp can change their rules anytime. Your website is yours forever.

### 3. Better Customer Service

With a website, customers can:
- Find your location and hours instantly
- Browse your products/services anytime
- Contact you through multiple channels
- Read FAQs without calling you

### 4. Reach More Customers

90% of consumers search online before making a purchase. Without a website, you're invisible to these potential customers.

### 5. Compete with Bigger Businesses

A well-designed website levels the playing field. A small business can look just as professional as a large corporation.

### 6. 24/7 Sales Representative

Your website works while you sleep. Customers can learn about your business, see your work, and even make purchases at any time.

### 7. Valuable Business Insights

With analytics, you can learn:
- Where your visitors come from
- What they're interested in
- How they found you
- What makes them convert
